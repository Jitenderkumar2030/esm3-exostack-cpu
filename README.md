Here is a comprehensive `README.md` file for your `ESM` project that reflects the full structure and purpose of your integration:

---

```markdown
# ESM + ExoStack Integration Project

This repository integrates **EvolutionaryScale’s ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling)** models with the **ExoStack** deployment framework. It enables cutting-edge AI-based protein sequence modeling, inference, and deployment within containerized or cloud environments.

## 🧬 About ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling)

The ESM models are protein language models trained on massive protein sequence datasets. They can be used for:

* Protein structure and function prediction
* Mutation effect estimation
* Protein embedding generation
* Alignment-free sequence analysis

## 🚀 About ExoStack

ExoStack is a scalable, modular deployment platform built to execute and serve machine learning models in production environments. It includes:

* Agent-based execution (`exo_agent`)
* REST API and Web UI (`exo_hub`, `exo_ui`)
* Kubernetes and Docker support for scaling

---

## ✅ Running a Sample Inference (Example)

After activating your environment and installing requirements:

```bash
python esm/esm/pretrained.py
```

To run with ExoStack:

```bash
cd exostack
python cli.py run esm
```

*(Update as per your specific CLI structure and command usage)*

---

## 📝 Notes

* The `.git` folder in `esm/` was removed to avoid submodule-related issues.
* Make sure to install all required packages using the correct `requirements.txt`.
* You can build and run ExoStack via Docker/Kubernetes for scalable deployments.
